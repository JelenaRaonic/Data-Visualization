# Data-Visualization - Pymaceutical 

Pymaceuticals Inc. is a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medication. As a senior data analyst, I was given access to the complete data from their most recent study that included 249 mice, who were identified with SCC tumors and were receiving treatment with different drug regiments. The time they were observed and their tumor measured is 45 days.

In this project the analysis was done and it contains following:

1. Cleaned and prepared data
2. Summary Statistics
3. a) Bar Charts - for total number of rows (MouseID/Timepoints) for each drug regiment throughout the study.
   
   b) Pie Charts - distribution of female vs male mice in the study.
5. Final tumor volume of each mouse across four most promising treatment regiments. Calculated quartiles and IQR, and outliers. Box plot was 
   created to show distribution of the final tumore volume for all the mice in each treatment group.
6. a) Line Plot - Tumor volume vs Timepoint for a single mouse that was treated with Capomulin
   
   b) Scatter Plot - mouse weight vs average observed tumor volume
8. Correlation and Regression - between mouse weigth and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen.

I greatly appreciate help from Learning Assistant in part where some minor errors occured.
